      <p>I finally decided to build a proper personal website to showcase my research and projects. After relying on institutional profiles and scattered repositories, I wanted a central place to document my work.</p>
      <p>This site is built with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Vite</strong>, hosted statically on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>. It's designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain.</p>
      <p>In the coming months, I plan to write about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CPU-FPGA Co-design and Heterogeneous Computing</li>
        <li>High-Level Synthesis (HLS) optimization techniques</li>
        <li>Updates on my PhD research progress</li>
        <li>Interesting coding challenges and solutions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Feel free to look around and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!</p>
