I finally decided to build a proper personal website to showcase my research and projects. After relying on institutional profiles and scattered repositories, I wanted a central place to document my work.

This site is built with **React** and **Vite**, hosted statically on **GitHub Pages**. It's designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain.

In the coming months, I plan to write about:

* CPU-FPGA Co-design and Heterogeneous Computing
* High-Level Synthesis (HLS) optimization techniques
* Updates on my PhD research progress
* Interesting coding challenges and solutions

Feel free to look around and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
