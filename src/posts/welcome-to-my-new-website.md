As the end of my PhD research and teaching duties dawns on me, and I start to adopt a more industry-looking profile, I have decided to finally build a proper personal website. I've tried to collect everything of note that best showcases what I've been doing, from an (hopefully) always up-to-date CV, a list of all publications I've done during my MSc and PhD, a portfolio showcasing my best open-source projects, and also a little blog section, which I hope to fill in as time goes on.

I've also used this opportunity to continue experimenting with AI agents, and more specifically Google's Antigravity IDE. While I know my way around web development, I was rather displeased with the static site generator I had been using (Hugo), and therefore decided to let Antigravity suggest a framework and create all the scaffolding for me to fill in. I was pleased with the result, and after a lot of manual fine-tuning, I think it turned out well. I still have many questions about how these AI agents can adequately scale for big, production-ready applications that have years of tech debt on them - you know, the majority of software out there - without causing more headaches than they end up solving... but for prototyping, exploration and smaller projects, they're quite alright.

All content on this blog is, however, 100% human-written, notwithstanding the contribution of spellcheckers and the like.
