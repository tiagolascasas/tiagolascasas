### Hi there 👋 Stay awhile, and listen!

I am a PhD student and TA at the University of Porto, Faculty of Engineering ([FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_page.Inicial)) and [INESC-TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en).

My PhD thesis is about the simultaneous and holistic partitioning and optimization of C/C++ applications in CPU-FPGA systems. You can peruse [this poster](https://tiagolascasas.github.io/tiagolascasas/pdf/PACT_2023_Poster.pdf) if you want to know more!

You can also check out my papers [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jh9yL_YAAAAJ&hl=en).
