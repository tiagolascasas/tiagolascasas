### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Stay awhile, and listen

I am a PhD student and TA at the University of Porto, Faculty of Engineering ([FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_page.Inicial)) and [INESC-TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en).

My PhD thesis is about the simultaneous and holistic partitioning and optimization of C/C++ applications in CPU-FPGA systems. You can peruse [this poster](https://tiagolascasas.github.io/tiagolascasas/pdf/FCCM_2025_PhD_Forum_Poster.pdf) if you want to know more!
