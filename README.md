### Hi there 👋 Stay awhile, and listen!

I am Tiago, a PhD student and TA at the University of Porto, Faculty of Engineering ([FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/web_page.Inicial)) and [INESC-TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my PhD thesis, about the simultaneous partitioning and optimization of C/C++ applications in CPU-FPGA systems. You can peruse [this poster](https://tiagolascasas.github.io/tiagolascasas/pdf/PACT_2023_Poster.pdf) if you want to know more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about MLIR, and assessing whether it would make sense to integrate in my own work. I am also eagerly awaiting the right opportunity to finally use Rust in a project.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything about code transformations for accelerators! I have a task graph representation that will be open-sourced very soon, and which may be of interest to many other people.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with setting up CI/CD pipelines for automatically synthesizing and executing HLS kernels on AMD/Xilinx hardware. If you have experience with that, please reach out!
- 💬 Ask me about my published papers! You can check them out [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jh9yL_YAAAAJ&hl=en).
- 📫 How to reach me: tiagolascasas at outlook dot com. I am also on LinkedIn and Discord under the same handle.
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them when referring to me in English, if you please.
- ⚡ Fun fact: did you know that I have all this information, and much more, on [my personal website](https://tiagolascasas.github.io/tiagolascasas)?
